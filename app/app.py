Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used to implement the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configuration variables
loan_application_limit = 1000
loan_application_increase = 0.2
regulatory_change_time = 30
business_process_change_time = 15

# API endpoint for loan application submission
@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def submit_loan_application():
    # Process loan application submission logic here
    return 'Loan application submitted successfully'

# API endpoint for system configuration
@app.route('/system-configuration', methods=['POST'])
def configure_system():
    # Process system configuration logic here
    return 'System configured successfully'

# API endpoint for regulatory change
@app.route('/regulatory-change', methods=['POST'])
def handle_regulatory_change():
    # Process regulatory change logic here
    return 'Regulatory change handled successfully'

# API endpoint for business process change
@app.route('/business-process-change', methods=['POST'])
def handle_business_process_change():
    # Process business process change logic here
    return 'Business process change handled successfully'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code sets up a Flask application with four API endpoints: `/loan-application` for submitting loan applications, `/system-configuration` for configuring the system, `/regulatory-change` for handling regulatory changes, and `/business-process-change` for handling business process changes.

The configuration variables at the top of the code can be adjusted to meet the acceptance criteria. For example, `loan_application_limit` can be set to 1000 to handle a minimum of 1000 loan applications per day, and `loan_application_increase` can be set to 0.2 to accommodate a 20% increase in loan application volume.

The logic for processing loan application submission, system configuration, regulatory changes, and business process changes can be implemented within the respective API endpoints.

Note that this is a basic example and additional code may be required to fully implement the desired functionality, such as database integration, error handling, and version control mechanisms.
